# EDA-Analysis

In this project, the primary focus was to enhance customer experience and boost revenue through the analysis of sales data. To achieve this, Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were utilized to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project was divided into two main parts: Data Cleaning and EDA.

During the Data Cleaning phase, the sales dataset was processed to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring the data's integrity and reliability. Afterward, the EDA commenced, where various parameters were examined to gain valuable insights.

The analysis began by investigating the purchasing behavior of customers based on gender. The objective was to ascertain which gender contributed more to overall sales. Additionally, the study delved into different age groups, identifying the age bracket that made the highest number of purchases. The EDA further explored the marital status of individuals who made substantial purchases, providing valuable information about the target audience.

Furthermore, the occupation of the customers was studied, as it plays a crucial role in understanding the preferences and spending habits of different professional groups. All these aspects were visualized using graphs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the data and revealing meaningful patterns and trends.

Finally, after a thorough analysis, the project's conclusion was drawn. It highlighted key findings, actionable insights, and recommendations to improve customer experience and increase revenue. By leveraging the power of Python libraries and a robust EDA approach, the project successfully provided valuable information to optimize sales strategies and enhance overall business performance.
